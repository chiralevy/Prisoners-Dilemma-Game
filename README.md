# Prisoner's Dilemma Game

Several years ago, I made a CLI game simulating the dynamics of one of my favorite frameworks in game theory--the prisoner's dilemma.
To make this game, I used object-oriented programming and, most importantly, lots of creativity to make for a fun experience. 
My file is heavily commented such that every function used has a correponding explanation. It also has the following description at the top which briefly 
introduces the setting and rules of the game:

*A great deal of game theory explores how competing people decide when the consequences of their decisions depend of the actions of others.
In this program, I simulate a classic example of a game analyzed in game theory known as the prisoner's dilemma.
In the game, two criminals (here, you and someone else) are being interrogated and must either confess to a crime or keep quiet.
Whether you are freed or imprisoned is contingent upon the actions of the other criminal.*
